# IntelliJ plugin for ts-error-translator

## Objectives
Currently the ts-error-translator can be accessed from the web or as as vscode plugin.
The purpose of this plugin is to allow intellj users to get clear and simple explanations for typescript errors as an integrated part of their work environment.

## UI
In intelliJ, typescript errors are shown in the problems tab (see screenshot)

When you right click on an error, there is a menue with an option for 'show error details'

We would like this tooltip to include the description from ts-errors-translator
